# Solar Powered Touch-less Soap, Water and Paper Towel Dispenser
In response to the recent COVID-19 Pandemic and the need to wash our hands regularly. I came up with this prototype. which is a solar powered soap, water and paper dispenser that eliminates the need to touch the tap, soap or apaer dispenser. this is an on-going project that I intend to modify to a full blown self sustaining system (looking into recycling the water and add some AI capabilities).

This project was initiated by my wife who wanted me to make a popular bucket in Ghana (Veronica Bucket) Touch-less. After roaming most of the plumbing shops ad not finding a tap, this is what i came up with.
